# SnapFlow Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SnapFlow ("the Project").

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, the Project Owner must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the Project and its Owner; it does not change your right to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

## 1. Definitions

"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with the Project Owner.

"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Project Owner for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by the Project Owner (the "Work").

## 4. Representations

You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above assignment and licenses. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to the Project Owner.

You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation.
